# aleph-elasticsearch

This is a vendored version of ElasticSearch, suitable for use with the main Aleph application.
The principal additions are plugins for ICU, repository support for AWS and GCP, and the 
synonym file used to expand queries for names in Aleph. That file is based on the adjacent
`synonames` project:
